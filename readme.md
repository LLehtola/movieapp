1) Write a simple application that provides movie suggestions for a user based on their movie genre preference. You can choose tools and libraries that you use yourself. Provide a REST API for this. We want to use multiple external services like Netflix or IMDB for the recommendations. Let's assume that you don't have access to those external services yet, don't know their exact API yet, but have to implement something now and use the APIs later.

Tips and questions to consider:
- What kind of architecture would you use to achieve this?
- How would you design the application for testability?
- There is no need to implement persistence but how would you take that into account in the design?

2) If you later decided to migrate to a microservices architecture, what kind of patterns would you use for this? No implementation needed.
